My name is Aleksandr.  

I had a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics and physics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.  
I was supposed to be a scientist who leverages my knowledge for wing-shape optimization or adaptive mesh generation after the university.  
But right before my master's degree, I realized that it's not my path with a heart.  
I changed my life and began a long journey to my dream, to be an outstanding software engineer.  
Now I'm a software developer with five years of experience, and that's merely the beginning.
