Hi there!

Welcome to Ever Alerta site!

My name is Aleksandr.
I graduated from physics and technology university.
Then I realized that software engineering is my path with a heart.

Here I would like to post IT-related articles and some information about myself.

Thank you for visiting, and stay tuned!
